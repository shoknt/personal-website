  bio: "Hey there, I'm chok!



Started managing & moderating communities over a decade ago as a volunteer (forum moderator, game Game moderator, game helper, etc) in several forums & games with the goal of assisting users and building safe & healthy communities in the gaming sphere. That same goal has been my motivator to continuously grow, hone, and practice my skills as I worked in Customer Support, Content Moderation, and Community Management.



Working directly with Discord on launching several VIP & brand communities as part of their Discord Moderator Program has led to so many amazing learning opportunities in regards to managing different types of communities and audiences.

I started programming at a young age, and I am improving myself every day",
